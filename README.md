# Chat-App-files

# Concept:
This application will serve as a platform that will let us chat to another android using Firebase database. The chatting will be secured as we are using cryptography.
The main concept behind it is to develop an application where 2 android users can chat without any fear of getting their data hacked in middle of the communication.
I have used AES Algorithm for encryption and decryption. And even at the database level we can’t see the message as it is end-to-end encrypted.
